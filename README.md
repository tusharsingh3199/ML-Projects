# ML PROJECTS LIST:
# 1. Malaria Cell Detection using TensorFlow

This project focuses on detecting malaria-infected cells from microscopic images using **deep learning techniques**.  
Two approaches were implemented:
1. **Custom CNN Base Model** – built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.  
2. **Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning** – leveraging pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
