# ML PROJECTS LIST:
# 1. Malaria Cell Detection using TensorFlow

This project focuses on detecting malaria-infected cells from microscopic images using **deep learning techniques**. Two approaches were implemented:
1. **Custom CNN Base Model** – built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras. Results: F1 Score = 96%, Accuracy = 96%.
2. **Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning** – leveraging pre-trained models (ResNet50) to improve accuracy and reduce training time. Results: F1 Score = 97%, Accuracy = 97%.
